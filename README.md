Welcome to my Pizza Sales Data Analytics project! In this project, I analyzed a pizza sales dataset to uncover business insights and create an interactive dashboard using **Tableau**. This project involved working with raw sales data using **SQL**, data cleaning and processing, and finally building visualizations that provide actionable KPIs for decision-makers.
